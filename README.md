### Projects
### Modelling Maternal and Neonatal Deaths in Jember Regency with BGPR 
[Thesis](https://repository.its.ac.id/114979)

This project analyzes the factors influencing maternal and neonatal deaths in Kabupaten Jember, East Java, using Bivariate Generalized Poisson Regression (BGPR). The study identifies key health indicators, such as antenatal care visits, healthcare facility deliveries, and postpartum care, that significantly impact maternal and neonatal mortality rates. The BGPR model was chosen due to its ability to handle count data with overdispersion, providing insights into the interrelated nature of maternal and neonatal health outcomes. The results aim to inform targeted interventions to reduce mortality and improve public health in the region.
